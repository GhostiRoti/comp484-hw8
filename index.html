                <h3>Google Certified UX Designer || Programmer || Unity Certified Game Developer || Sick Gamer >:D</h3>
                <p> 8 years of Programming, 2 years of UX Design, 2 years of Game Development. Life long problem solver.
                    I'm a skilled leader, quick learner, and motivated team player.
                    I speak English and French and know many programming languages including C#, Java, C++, RUST, and more.
                    Currently on my Junior Year as a student at California State University Northridge. I'm also pretty good at video games.
                    The highlights of my life to date have always been part of a team.
                    It's these moments I perform my best work, because I'm deeply motivated to make a team succeed.
                    I love helping others, and doing my part for everyone to reach their goals.
                    My ambitions are to gain a master's in computer science, develop culture/language learning applications, and to one day have the resources to develop my dream video game.

                    <p> Worked as a Team Manager and currently UX designer/web engineer for Friends of Chimps and their website.
                        I adopted these roles when it was clear these critical needs were missing.
                        As Team manager I created guidelines for programmers, UX designers, graphic designers, and team coordinators to follow in order to keep tasks running smoothly.
                        I also performed user research, and designed pages for the new website along side my teammates.
                        I then orchestrated tests, layed out operation and approval pipelines, reviewed work of the different teams, and managed deligation for data security (I did not consult nor work on data security).
